/data : a collection of raw and processed trial data, forest data, transformed trial data (i.e., masks).

  /forests : csv files containing dataframes with columns ['x','y','r']. Artificial forests are marked by a datetime postfix in their file name.

  /masks : Discretized frames generated from real (i.e., original_set) and fake (i.e., random_set) forests. Within these directories, frames are organized by mothid. The frames themselves are stored in a pickle file as a dictionary of trial ids and sets of masks.

  /single_trials : HDF files containing trial-sized slices of Yoyo's bulk data frame. Trials are defined by datetime.

  ### TODO: add original HDF of all trials
  /trials : Original set of trials and files describing trial conditions and obstacles for each moth.

/examples : Illustrations of expected mask, score, and trajectory outputs.

  /frames : Plots of sample masks saved as .png.

  /scores : Plots of sample scores saved as .png.

  /trajectory_plots : Plots of sample scores saved as .png.

/scripts : Python and BASH scripts used to analyse trial data.

  /fileio_and_visual : Scripts used to 1) load/save 'csv' and 'hdf' files, and 2) plot various data generated by scripts in preprocess_trajs and score_trajs.

  /preprocess_trajs : Scripts used to obtain single trajectories and transform them into a set of masks.

  /score_trajs : Scripts used to process trial masks into single score values.

  /test : Contains example input and output for doctests in fileio_and_visual, preprocess_trajs, and score_trajs.
